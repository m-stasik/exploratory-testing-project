# 🔍 Exploratory Testing Project – OLX Mobile & Zephyr Scale

This repository presents the results of exploratory testing I performed on two real-world applications: **OLX (mobile version)** and **Zephyr Scale** (a test management plugin for Jira).

## 🧪 Project Overview

Exploratory testing is a hands-on testing approach where test design, execution, and learning happen simultaneously.  
The goal of this project was to strengthen my practical testing skills by exploring real applications without predefined scripts or step-by-step instructions.

## 🧭 Scope of Testing

As part of my QA portfolio, I performed **exploratory and functional testing** on two real-world applications. The testing was aimed at identifying usability issues, UI inconsistencies, and edge-case defects. Below is a brief summary of the tested systems:

---

### 📱 OLX – Mobile Application

Tested core features such as login, search, media upload, and navigation on a real device (**iPhone 13 Pro, iOS 15**).  
OLX is a **global marketplace platform** used by **over 300 million users in 30+ countries**, which makes it a complex, high-traffic, production-level application.

During testing, I identified various UI/UX issues, functional bugs, and inconsistencies, which were documented as part of structured bug reports.

---

### 🧩 Zephyr Scale – Jira Plugin

Used as a **test management tool** for organizing test cases and execution cycles.  
While working with Zephyr Scale, I encountered several UI and formatting issues and treated them as part of a separate **exploratory testing session**.

Zephyr Scale is a popular Jira plugin used by QA teams worldwide for managing manual and automated test processes. My experience includes writing test cases and reporting real issues found within the tool itself.


## 🎯 Goal

This project demonstrates:
- My ability to conduct self-directed exploratory testing
- Experience with both user-facing and technical tools
- Clear, structured bug reporting
- Real-world application of testing theory and intuition
