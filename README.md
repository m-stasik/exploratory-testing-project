# 🔍 Exploratory Testing Project – OLX Mobile & Zephyr Scale

This repository presents the results of exploratory testing I performed on two real-world applications: **OLX (mobile version)** and **Zephyr Scale** (a test management plugin for Jira).

## 🧪 Project Overview

Exploratory testing is a hands-on testing approach where test design, execution, and learning happen simultaneously.  
The goal of this project was to strengthen my practical testing skills by exploring real applications without predefined scripts or step-by-step instructions.

## 🧭 Scope of Testing

### 1. **OLX – Mobile Application**
The OLX mobile app was tested on smartphones to simulate a realistic user experience. The testing focused on exploring the core functionalities, user interface, and navigation patterns.  
This helped evaluate both my exploratory techniques and my ability to identify unexpected or inconsistent behaviors.

### 2. **Zephyr Scale – Jira Plugin**
Zephyr Scale was originally used as a test management tool during another project. While working within the application, I encountered certain irregularities that I treated as part of a separate exploratory testing session.  
I documented those findings in the same structured way as for the OLX app.


## 🎯 Goal

This project demonstrates:
- My ability to conduct self-directed exploratory testing
- Experience with both user-facing and technical tools
- Clear, structured bug reporting
- Real-world application of testing theory and intuition
